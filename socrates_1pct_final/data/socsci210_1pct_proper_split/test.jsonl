Up until a year ago, life was pretty okay for David. While nothing much is going wrong in David\u2019s life, he sometimes feels worried, a little sad, or has trouble sleeping at night. David feels that at times things bother him more than they bother other people and that when things go wrong, he sometimes gets nervous or annoyed. Otherwise, David is getting along pretty well. He enjoys being with other people and although David sometimes argues with his family, David has been getting along pretty well with his family. Because he has been having these problems, David was evaluated by a doctor who determined that he is very distressed but does not have a mental illness. While the doctor does not know for sure why David has developed his condition, he thinks it may be genetic because David\u2019s father, his father\u2019s father, and his aunt on his mother\u2019s side are all very similar to him. When explaining the results of his evaluation to David, the doctor suggested that David consider a course of mental health treatment that is known to be helpful in treating David\u2019s condition.\" Then you were asked: \"How willing would you be to spend an evening socializing with David?\" Only return an integer from 1 to 5, where 1 means Very unwilling and 5 means Very willing, nothing else.","output":"Response: 4","study_id":"zaqkm","condition_num":5}
