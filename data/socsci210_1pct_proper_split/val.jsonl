Renters were more than five times more likely to move than homeowners. The estimates also reveal that many of the nation\u2019s fastest-growing cities are suburbs. Specifically, big cities within metropolitan areas experienced a net loss of 2.1 million movers, while the suburbs had a net gain of 2.4 million movers.

The national mover rate increased from 8.4% in 2020 (the lowest rate since the Pew Research Center began tracking the data) to 9.3% in 2021. According to the new data, 30 million people changed residences in the U.S. within the past year. 81.7% of all movers stayed within the same state. Renters were more than five times more likely to move than homeowners. The estimates also reveal that many of the nation\u2019s fastest-growing cities are suburbs. Specifically, big cities within metropolitan areas experienced a net loss of 2.1 million movers, while the suburbs had a net gain of 2.4 million movers.

Born in Michigan and a registered voter, Davenport beat out longtime incumbent John Harrison, winning nearly 62% of the vote. In 2013, Davenport was the first Black woman elected to city council, on which she has served since. As the first Black woman from [city name redacted] to serve as mayor, Davenport hopes this marks a moment in history, encouraging other Black Americans and women to enter into politics. Speaking on her mayoral win, Davenport comments, \u201cWe have the resources, we have the activism, we have the ideas to be a city that is welcoming to everyone. We see communities really walled off from each other by geography and by neighborhood as well. So, I come with a drive to make sure that we are building a city that everybody feels reflected in and welcome in.\u201d\u201d and then were asked: \u201cTo what extent do you agree with the following statement: Davenport would represent the interests of my community?

Unlike many minority groups in the U.S. today, there is widespread disagreement about whether the group as a whole should be considered White or non-White, in part because the group includes so many different skin tones. Because not everyone agrees on how to classify Latinos, social scientists have become interested in studying how perceptions of this group may be changing. Our polling data suggest that, in contrast to Italians and Greeks\u2014two groups whose own racial classification used to be debated for similar reasons, but who are now considered fully White\u2014it seems unlikely that Latinos will become fully included in the White category within the next few decades. The last few years have seen little change in the number of Americans who categorize Latinos as White.
