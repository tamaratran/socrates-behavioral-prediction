According to the new data, 30 million people changed residences in the U.S. within the past year. 81.7% of all movers stayed within the same state. Renters were more than five times more likely to move than homeowners. The estimates also reveal that many of the nation\u2019s fastest-growing cities are suburbs. Specifically, big cities within metropolitan areas experienced a net loss of 2.1 million movers, while the suburbs had a net gain of 2.4 million movers. Our projections suggest that in about two decades, movers will be almost twice as likely to be moving to a suburb instead of a city.\u201d and then were asked: \u201cAccording to the passage you read earlier, what is the likelihood that Latinos will be considered White in the U.S. in the near future?\u201d Only return an integer from 1 to 4, nothing else.",

A single case of smallpox is likely to represent a bioterrorism release and will require an immediate and coordinated public health, medical, and law enforcement response to control the outbreak and to protect the public from any additional release. The information below describes a fictional smallpox outbreak designed to mimic the events and public health decisions that might occur during an actual bioterrorist attack scenario.' and then read the following message: 'As the designated lead agency for the national public health response to biological terrorism, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently confirmed several cases of smallpox occurring in your community. Officials are investigating these cases as an act of terrorism and health officials are working together to quickly find, vaccinate, and treat people who may have been exposed to the smallpox virus. Finding people who have been exposed, vaccinating, and treating them and their contacts is a proven method for stopping the spread of smallpox. The CDC\u2019s response to the current smallpox outbreak builds on concepts and approaches that were successfully employed 30 to 40 years ago to control smallpox outbreaks. These overall concepts for outbreak containment contributed greatly to the eventual global eradication of smallpox. In addition, lessons learned from recent public health crises, such as the anthrax attacks in 2001 and the emergence of SARS in 2003, have been incorporated into CDC\u2019s response to the current smallpox outbreak. The smallpox vaccine is the best protection you can get if you are exposed to the smallpox virus. Vaccination within three days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms in the vast majority of people. Anyone directly exposed to smallpox, regardless of health status, will be offered the smallpox vaccine because the risks associated with smallpox disease are far greater than those posed by the vaccine. The CDC, in collaboration with the County Health Department, has assigned local health workers to your community who are responsible for getting accurate information out to your neighborhood. These local health workers are recommending vaccinations to protect against smallpox for you and your neighbors.'. You were then asked: 'If you had to make a decision now, would you get the recommended smallpox vaccine?' Only return 1 for 'Yes' or 2 for 'No', nothing else.",
